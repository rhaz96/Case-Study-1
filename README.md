# Analysis of Beer
## Authors: Jim Holdnack, Robert Hazell

This is a class project for MSDS 6371 Doing Data Science, the purpose of which is to illustrate data cleaning, data analysis, and project management skills. 

We're tasked with analyzing beer and brewery data to find quantitative and qualitative info.  This includes descriptive statistics on bitterness and alcohol content, as well as info on beer types and manufacturing location.

The purpose is to imagine presenting a business proposal to a beer company.  As market research, this project answers the questions of which US geographical location(s) the company should expand to and the beer offering(s) it should make.

The analysis is done with R using the *dplyr*, *ggplot2*, and *rvest* packages.  The raw data can be found in the *Beers.csv* and *Breweries.csv* files.

Key variables from *Beers.csv*:
* ABV = alcohol by volume
* IBU = International Bitterness Units
* Brewery_ID = unique brewery identifier

Key Variables from *Brewers.csv:*
* State = State in which the beer was produced 
* Brew_ID = unique brewery identifier

Files are merged based on unique brewery ID

Note: for the purposes of this project additional data was identified from the web to help frame an understanding of beer consumption by state. This data can be found [here](http://scottjanish.com/map-per-capita-gallons-beer-consumed-per-adult-state).
